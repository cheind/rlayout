= RLayout
This package contains RLayout, a flexible packaging system for files. 

RLayout is motivated by the fact that packaging software for distribution can be a tedious tasks. Often files from various sources need to be copied and filtered, including but not limited to documentation, binaries and source code. Additional external information needs to be downloaded such as the latest test results or the latest wording of the license agreement. Hours later, after zipping everything up, your software is ready to be released.

RLayout originates in the idea relieve the developer of performing these tasks manually. RLayout is, of course, not limited to process of the packaging of software releases. 

RLayout offers the following features
- Import from your local file system using flexible globbing expressions.
- Import from ftp sources.
- Import from http sources.
- Export packages to the local file system.
- Export packages as compressed zip files.
- Simple extension API to provide custom importers and exporters.

== Introductionary Example
Here is an example that shows importers and exporters work together

 # Here's an example of packaging up a software release 
 # for some exotic product using RLayout
    
 package = RLayout.vfs_group("Exotic-#{Time.now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}")
 package.inc       << RLayout.lfs_glob('path/to/includes/**/*.[h,hpp]') 
 package.src       << RLayout.lfs_glob('path/to/src/*')
 package.doc       << RLayout.http_file('https://api.docs.org/latest.pdf')
 package.testdata  << RLayout.ftp_file('ftp://build.server.org/testdata.zip')
 package           << RLayout.mem_text('readme.txt', 'Exotic - Readme ... ')
    
 # No data has been read until this point.
    
 runtime = Runtime.new
 runtime.exporters << Exporters.lfs_directory('c:/temp/')
 runtime.exporters << Exporters.lfs_zipfile('c:/temp/myzip.zip')
 runtime.run(r, :dry_run => true)
 
== Design Overview
RLayout uses importers to accumulate content from various sources. These RLayout.Importers provide information nodes (VFSNode) for RLayouts virtual file system (VFSGroup). These nodes contain information on the content and methods to read the content in chunks. Once the importing step is completed, RLayout uses exporters (RLayout.Exporters) to package the content of the virtual file system physically.
